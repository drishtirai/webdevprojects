                I started my programming journey in 2022 with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. I was determined to become a full-stack developer, so I
                continued learning and practicing new programming languages until I
                mastered them. Along the way, I also picked up some extra skills such
                as video editing, graphic design, audio editing, and more. I am proud
                of my accomplishments and I am excited to continue on this journey, to
                keep learning new things, and to explore new opportunities that will
                help me grow even more as a developer.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <br />
                <li>After mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I expanded my skills to
                    include other programming languages like React, React Native, PHP,
                    MySQL, and Flutter.</li><br />
                <li> With my knowledge of React, I was able to build interactive and
                    responsive user interfaces for web applications.</li><br />
                <li> I also learned React Native, which enabled me to develop mobile
                    applications for both iOS and Android devices.</li><br />
                <li>My knowledge of PHP and MySQL allowed me to create dynamic and
                    database-driven websites and web applications.</li><br />
                <li>I also explored Flutter, a framework for building cross-platform
                    mobile applications with a single codebase, which helped me to
                    expand my skill set and broaden my development capabilities.</li><br />
                <li>In addition to programming languages, I developed expertise in video
                    editing, graphic design, and audio editing, which have allowed me to
                    add rich multimedia content to my applications and websites.</li><br />
                <li> Throughout my journey, I have been dedicated to learning and
                    improving my skills, and I look forward to continuing to grow and
                    explore new opportunities as a developer.</li>
